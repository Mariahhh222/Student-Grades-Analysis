"Student Grade Processing Tool"
This is a simple Java program that lets you input decimal grades for students and calculates the average, highest, and lowest grade.
The program prompts you to enter grades one by one and will display the average, highest, and lowest grades when you're done.
To use it, clone the repository, compile the Task1.java file with javac, and run it using java Task1. 
Enter your grades, and when you're finished, type done to see the results.
The program will handle invalid inputs and ask you to enter valid decimal numbers. 
It's a basic tool for managing student grades.
